# Treb Deploy script
#
# This script will push out a Treb site from a SVN repo to all appropriate servers.
#  Make sure to edit the server-lists in the arrays to match existing servers.
#
# This was a one-off program that was used for a specific application, and has been made
#  a little more configurable at this point.  There are decent chances that you may need
#  to actually hack this to use it for your our situation; however, it's very straight
#  forward to understand and make said changes.
#
# To use, make sure that you have 'svn', 'scp', and 'ssh' all accessible to
#  you as well as /tmp usable as a temp directory.  Then just run the script,
#  per the $USAGE string below, specifying a target (test, live) as well as
#  either a branch, a tag, or the trunk as what is being pushed.  It should
#  do the rest for you.
#
# There are a number of assumptions that this deployment script makes, even given the
#   configurability that it does have, If you want to change these assumptions, you will need
#   to edit the script:
#  * That standard unix utils (svn, scp, ssh, etc) will be available in the path
#  * That you sure your codebase in SVN, protected by username/password
#  * That you will deploy to remote servers, protected by a username and an identity key
#    (aka, private key).  This is, for example, how Amazon AWS servers are default protected
#  * That you will store this key in your SVN, and provide the path to it.
#  * That you want a set of standard practices, compressing JS/CSS, unless already minified,
#    to send emails to an address on any TAG push (assuming that a tag means something final),
#    that you want to make announcements via an IRC bot, etc.
#  * That you will name configuration files in /config/ of treb, the same as your target types.
#    So if you have a target of 'live', then you will have a live.config.xml file.
#  * That this deploys to a directory on the servers of your choosing, but automatically creates
#    a subdirectory with the name of the 'target', and then makes a unique directory for the deploy
#    and at the end, aliases /current to the latest.  Your apache webroot should be configured to
#    look for this 'current' directory.
#
##############################################################################

# Define your valid deployment targets, such as 'dev', 'test', 'live', etc.  And for each of them
#  make a list of servers that will be deployed to when you push to that target.  Each of these
#  lists is space-separated and machines to push to.  IP or DNS is fine.
